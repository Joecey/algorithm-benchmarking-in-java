# Algorithm Benchmarking in Java
## Joe Linogao - 2025

This project is used to benchmark a collection of algorithms using a basic start-stop benchmarking
strategy. The program performs each sort 10 times and saves the average runtime in milliseconds for 
every array size the user has requested. The algorithms currently implemented are as follows:
- Bubble Sort
- Counting Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Selection Sort 

## Running the program
